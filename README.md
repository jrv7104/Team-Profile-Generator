This is a team profile generator that utilizes node.js to create an HTML file displaying the manager, engineers and interns on the team along with their contact information. The manager has an office number option, the engineers can enter their GitHub username, and interns can enter their school that they currently attend. This project also has a test that can be run for each class, and those files are in the lib directory. While the tests are simple, they all pass.

Unfortunately my plan was once "node index.js" is ran in the terminal, an HTML file would have been created from the information entered in the terminal from the prompts, but despite troubleshooting efforts from myself and instructors and tutors I was unsuccessful in that endeavor. I wanted to at least show what I have done as I feel I am close, then resubmit it when it is figured out and complete. That and styling will be updated at a later time.
