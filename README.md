This is a team profile generator that utilizes node.js to create an HTML file displaying the manager, engineers and interns on the team along with their contact information. The manager has an office number option, the engineers can enter their GitHub username, and interns can enter their school that they currently attend. This project also has a test that can be run for each class, and those files are in the lib directory. While the tests are simple, they all pass.

The first time I submitted this assignment the html file wouldn't create, but with some help that issue has been fixed. Styling is something that could be added later, but I wanted to resubmit this assignment to show the improvement and functionality.
