This is a team profile generator that utilizes node.js to create an HTML file displaying the manager, engineers and interns on the team along with their contact information. The manager has an office number option, the engineers can enter their GitHub username, and interns can enter their school that they currently attend. This project also has a test that can be run for each class, and those files are in the lib directory. While the tests are simple, they all pass.

Once "node index.js" is ran in the terminal, an HTML file will be created from the information entered in the terminal from the prompts. Styling will be updated at a later time as my biggest focus was to make sure the functionality is correct.
